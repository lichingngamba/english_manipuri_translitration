13,the lord said both renunciation and selfless action achieve salvation but of the two the way of selfless action is the better because it is easier to practice,ꯏꯕꯨꯡꯉꯣ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯅꯥ ꯍꯥꯌꯈꯤ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯊꯥꯗꯣꯀꯄꯥ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯑꯅꯤꯃꯛꯅꯥ ꯑꯔꯥꯟ ꯈꯨꯕꯝ ꯐꯪꯏ ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯑꯅꯤꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯅꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯃꯁꯥꯅꯥ ꯃꯁꯥꯕꯨ ꯊꯥꯖꯗꯕꯥ ꯊꯕꯛꯀꯤ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯍꯦꯟꯅꯥ ꯐꯩ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯃꯁꯤ ꯆꯠꯅꯍꯅꯕꯗꯥ ꯍꯦꯟꯅꯥ ꯂꯥꯌꯕꯅꯤ꯫
14,if both the ways are equally effective in bringing about the final absolution why is the way of selfless action described as superior,ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯅꯤꯃꯛ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯔꯣꯏꯕꯥ ꯑꯦꯕꯁꯣꯜꯌꯨꯁꯟ ꯄꯨꯔꯀꯄꯗꯥ ꯆꯞ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯅꯥ ꯏꯐꯦꯛꯇꯤꯕ ꯑꯣꯏꯔꯕꯗꯤ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯤꯗꯃꯛꯇꯥ ꯁꯦꯜꯐꯂꯦꯁ ꯑꯦꯛꯁꯅꯒꯤ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯍꯦꯟꯅꯥ ꯐꯩ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯐꯣꯡꯗꯣꯛꯂꯤꯕꯅꯣ꯫

16,he o the mighty armed arjun who envies none and desires nothing is fit to be regarded as sanyasi and liberated from the conflicts of passion and repugnance he breaks away from worldly bondage,ꯃꯍꯥꯛ ꯍꯦ ꯀꯅꯥꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯕꯨ ꯏꯀꯥꯏ ꯈꯨꯝꯅꯗꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯥ ꯄꯥꯃꯗꯕꯥ ꯁꯛꯇꯤ ꯂꯩꯔꯕꯥ ꯈꯨꯠꯂꯥꯌ ꯄꯥꯌꯕꯥ ꯑꯔꯖꯨꯟ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯁꯟꯌꯥꯁꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯕꯥ ꯌꯥꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯄꯥꯃꯖꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯂꯥꯡꯇꯛꯅꯕꯒꯤ ꯂꯥꯅꯐꯃꯁꯤꯡꯗꯒꯤ ꯅꯥꯟꯊꯣꯀꯈꯤꯕꯥ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯅꯥ ꯃꯥꯂꯦꯃꯒꯤ ꯕꯣꯟꯗꯦꯖꯗꯒꯤ ꯂꯥꯄꯊꯣꯀꯏ |

19,it is the ignorant rather than men of wisdom who make a distinction between the way of knowledge and the way of action for he who dwells well in any one of the two attains to god,ꯂꯧꯁꯤꯡꯒꯤ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯊꯕꯛꯀꯤ ꯂꯝꯕꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯔꯛꯇꯥ ꯈꯦꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯊꯝꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯂꯧꯁꯤꯡ ꯂꯩꯕꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏꯁꯤꯡꯗꯒꯤ ꯍꯦꯟꯅꯥ ꯃꯍꯩ ꯌꯥꯜꯂꯣꯏꯗꯕꯅꯤ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯑꯅꯤꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯅꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯑꯃꯗꯥ ꯐꯖꯅꯥ ꯂꯩꯕꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯏꯁ꯭ꯕꯔꯗꯥ ꯌꯧꯏ꯫
20,only they who know but inadequately of spiritual life find the two ways divergent because the final outcome of both the same namely attainment of god,ꯊꯋꯥꯌꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯕꯥ ꯄꯨꯟꯁꯤꯒꯤ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯥ ꯈꯉꯕꯥ ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯃꯇꯤꯛ ꯆꯥꯗꯕꯥ ꯃꯈꯣꯌꯁꯤꯡ ꯈꯛꯇꯅꯥ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯅꯤ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯈꯦꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯎꯕꯥ ꯐꯪꯏ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯑꯅꯤꯃꯛꯀꯤ ꯑꯔꯣꯏꯕꯥ ꯃꯍꯩꯗꯤ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯏꯄꯨꯔꯣꯌꯕꯨ ꯐꯪꯕꯅꯤ꯫
21,that man perceives reality who regards the way of knowledge and the way of selfless action as identical because the liberation attained by knowledge is also achieved by selfless action,ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯁꯤꯡꯒꯤ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯕꯒꯤ ꯃꯑꯣꯡ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯔꯤꯑꯦꯂꯤꯇꯤꯕꯨ ꯂꯧꯏ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯂꯧꯁꯤꯡꯅꯥ ꯐꯪꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯂꯤꯕꯔꯦꯁꯟ ꯑꯁꯤꯁꯨ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯕꯅꯥ ꯐꯪꯏ꯫
22,the goal which is reached by the worshiper of knowledge and discrimination is also achieved by the doer of selfless action,ꯖ꯭ꯅꯥꯟ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯈꯦꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯊꯝꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯐꯪꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯄꯥꯟꯗꯝ ꯑꯗꯨꯁꯨ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯐꯪꯕꯥ ꯉꯝꯃꯤ꯫
23,so he knows the truth who regards the two ways as similar from the point of view of consequence,ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯅꯥ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯅꯤ ꯑꯁꯤꯕꯨ ꯐꯂꯒꯤ ꯃꯤꯠꯌꯦꯡꯗꯒꯤ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯂꯧꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯈꯉꯏ꯫
24,now when the two ways converge at the same point why krishn pronounce one preferable to the other,ꯍꯧꯖꯤꯛ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯅꯤ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯆꯞ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯃꯐꯃꯗꯥ ꯂꯥꯀꯄꯥ ꯃꯇꯃꯗꯥ ꯀꯔꯤꯒꯤꯗꯃꯛ ꯀ꯭ꯔ꯭ꯏꯁ꯭ꯅꯅꯥ ꯑꯃꯕꯨ ꯑꯇꯣꯞꯄꯥ ꯑꯃꯗꯒꯤ ꯍꯦꯟꯅꯥ ꯐꯩ ꯍꯥꯌꯅꯥ ꯐꯣꯡꯗꯣꯀꯄꯒꯦ |
25,but o the mighty armed renunciation is well highly impossible to achieve without selfless action but the one whose mind is set on god is soon united with him,ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯑꯣ ꯁꯛꯇꯤ ꯂꯩꯔꯕꯥ ꯈꯨꯠꯂꯥꯌ ꯄꯥꯌꯕꯥ ꯊꯥꯗꯣꯀꯄꯥ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯗꯅꯥ ꯌꯥꯝꯅꯥ ꯌꯥꯡꯅꯥ ꯐꯪꯕꯥ ꯉꯃꯗꯕꯥ ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯏꯁ꯭ꯕꯔꯗꯥ ꯋꯥꯈꯜ ꯊꯝꯂꯤꯕꯥ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯑꯊꯨꯕꯥ ꯃꯇꯃꯗꯥ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯀꯥ ꯑꯃꯠꯇꯥ ꯑꯣꯏꯅꯥ ꯄꯨꯟꯁꯤꯜꯂꯀꯏ꯫

28,therefore the sage who reflects on the identical god and whose mind and senses are stilled soon attains to that god by the performance of selfless action,ꯃꯔꯝ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯕꯥ ꯏꯁ꯭ꯕꯔ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯋꯥꯈꯜ ꯈꯅꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯍꯥꯛꯀꯤ ꯋꯥꯈꯜ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯏꯟꯗ꯭ꯔꯤꯁꯤꯡꯕꯨ ꯂꯦꯡꯗꯅꯥ ꯂꯩꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯔ꯭ꯏꯁꯤ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯑꯊꯨꯕꯥ ꯃꯇꯃꯗꯥ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯏꯁ꯭ꯕꯔ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯌꯧꯔꯀꯏ |
29,it is but evident that selfless action has also to be practiced on the way of knowledge because the requisite action for both the ways is the same,ꯑꯗꯨꯕꯨ ꯃꯁꯤ ꯃꯌꯦꯛ ꯁꯦꯡꯏ ꯃꯗꯨꯗꯤ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯕꯁꯨ ꯂꯧꯁꯤꯡꯒꯤ ꯂꯝꯕꯤꯗꯥ ꯆꯠꯅꯍꯅꯒꯗꯕꯅꯤ ꯃꯔꯃꯗꯤ ꯂꯝꯕꯤ ꯑꯅꯤꯃꯛꯀꯤ ꯃꯊꯧ ꯇꯥꯕꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯑꯁꯤ ꯑꯃꯒꯥ ꯑꯃꯒꯥ ꯃꯥꯟꯅꯩ꯫

32,whereas one devotes himself to the deed after a thorough appraisal of his own ability and with self dependence the other the doer of selfless action engages in the task with total reliance upon the adored god,ꯀꯅꯥꯒꯨꯝꯕꯥ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯇꯧꯕꯥ ꯉꯝꯕꯁꯤꯡ ꯑꯗꯨ ꯃꯄꯨꯡ ꯐꯥꯅꯥ ꯌꯦꯡꯁꯤꯜꯂꯕꯥ ꯃꯇꯨꯡꯗꯥ ꯑꯃꯁꯨꯡ ꯃꯁꯥꯅꯥ ꯃꯁꯥꯕꯨ ꯊꯥꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯃꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯀꯠꯊꯣꯛꯂꯕꯁꯨ ꯑꯇꯣꯞꯄꯥ ꯑꯃꯅꯥ ꯃꯁꯥꯒꯤ ꯑꯣꯏꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯤꯗꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯇꯧꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯃꯤꯑꯣꯏ ꯑꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯅꯤꯡꯖꯔꯤꯕꯥ ꯏꯁ꯭ꯕꯔ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯃꯄꯨꯡ ꯐꯥꯅꯥ ꯊꯥꯖꯕꯥ ꯊꯃꯗꯨꯅꯥ ꯊꯕꯛ ꯑꯗꯨꯗꯥ ꯌꯥꯑꯣꯏ꯫
